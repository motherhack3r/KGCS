      <Weakness ID="1004" Name="Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag" Abstraction="Variant" Structure="Simple" Status="Incomplete">
         <Description>The product uses a cookie to store sensitive information, but the cookie is not marked with the HttpOnly flag.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>The HttpOnly flag directs compatible browsers to prevent client-side script from accessing cookies. Including the HttpOnly flag in the Set-Cookie HTTP response header helps mitigate the risk associated with Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) where an attacker's script code might attempt to read the contents of a cookie and exfiltrate information obtained. When set, browsers that support the flag will not reveal the contents of the cookie to a third party via client-side script executed via XSS.</Extended_Description>

         <Background_Details>
            <Background_Detail>An HTTP cookie is a small piece of data attributed to a specific website and stored on the user's computer by the user's web browser. This data can be leveraged for a variety of purposes including saving information entered into form fields, recording user activity, and for authentication purposes. Cookies used to save or record information generated by the user are accessed and modified by script code embedded in a web page. While cookies used for authentication are created by the website's server and sent to the user to be attached to future requests. These authentication cookies are often not meant to be accessed by the web page sent to the user, and are instead just supposed to be attached to future requests to verify authentication details.</Background_Detail>

             <Description>Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input) with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)</Description>

      <Weakness ID="1007" Name="Insufficient Visual Distinction of Homoglyphs Presented to User" Abstraction="Base" Structure="Simple" Status="Incomplete">
         <Description>The product displays information or identifiers to a user, but the display mechanism does not make it easy for the user to distinguish between visually similar or identical glyphs (homoglyphs), which may cause the user to misinterpret a glyph and perform an unintended, insecure action.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>
            <xhtml:p>Some glyphs, pictures, or icons can be semantically distinct to a program, while appearing very similar or identical to a human user. These are referred to as homoglyphs. For example, the lowercase "l" (ell) and uppercase "I" (eye) have different character codes, but these characters can be displayed in exactly the same way to a user, depending on the font. This can also occur between different character sets. For example, the Latin capital letter "A" and the Greek capital letter "Α" (Alpha) are treated as distinct by programs, but may be displayed in exactly the same way to a user. Accent marks may also cause letters to appear very similar, such as the Latin capital letter grave mark "À" and its equivalent "Á" with the acute accent.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Adversaries can exploit this visual similarity for attacks such as phishing, e.g. by providing a link to an attacker-controlled hostname that looks like a hostname that the victim trusts. In a different use of homoglyphs, an adversary may create a back door username that is visually similar to the username of a regular user, which then makes it more difficult for a system administrator to detect the malicious username while reviewing logs.</xhtml:p>

               <Note>An attacker may ultimately redirect a user to a malicious website, by deceiving the user into believing the URL they are accessing is a trusted domain. However, the attack can also be used to forge log entries by using homoglyphs in usernames. Homoglyph manipulations are often the first step towards executing advanced attacks such as stealing a user's credentials, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), or log forgery. If an attacker redirects a user to a malicious site, the attacker can mimic a trusted domain to steal account credentials and perform actions on behalf of the user, without the user's knowledge. Similarly, an attacker could create a username for a website that contains homoglyph characters, making it difficult for an admin to review logs and determine which users performed which actions.</Note>

               <Body_Text>However, the URL above is comprised of Cyrillic characters that look identical to the expected ASCII characters. This results in most users not being able to distinguish between the two and assuming that the above URL is trusted and safe. The "e" is actually the "CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER IE" which is represented in HTML as the character &amp;#x435, while the "a" is actually the "CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER A" which is represented in HTML as the character &amp;#x430.  The "p", "c", and "o" are also Cyrillic characters in this example. Viewing the source reveals a URL of "http://www.&amp;#x435;x&amp;#x430;m&amp;#x440;l&amp;#x435;.&amp;#x441;&amp;#x43e;m".

      <Weakness ID="102" Name="Struts: Duplicate Validation Forms" Abstraction="Variant" Structure="Simple" Status="Incomplete">
         <Description>The product uses multiple validation forms with the same name, which might cause the Struts Validator to validate a form that the programmer does not expect.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>If two validation forms have the same name, the Struts Validator arbitrarily chooses one of the forms to use for input validation and discards the other. This decision might not correspond to the programmer's expectations, possibly leading to resultant weaknesses. Moreover, it indicates that the validation logic is not up-to-date, and can indicate that other, more subtle validation errors are present.</Extended_Description>

                  <xhtml:p>The concept of X-Frame-Options is well documented, but implementation of this protection mechanism is in development to cover gaps. There is a need for allowing frames from multiple domains.</xhtml:p>

               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>A developer can use a "frame-breaker" script in each page that should not be framed. This is very helpful for legacy browsers that do not support X-Frame-Options security feature previously mentioned.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>It is also important to note that this tactic has been circumvented or bypassed. Improper usage of frames can persist in the web application through nested frames. The "frame-breaking" script does not intuitively account for multiple nested frames that can be presented to the user.</xhtml:p>

            <Mitigation>
               <Phase>Implementation</Phase>
               <Description>This defense-in-depth technique can be used to prevent the improper usage of frames in web applications. It prioritizes the valid sources of data to be loaded into the application through the usage of declarative policies. Based on which implementation of Content Security Policy is in use, the developer should use the "frame-ancestors" directive or the "frame-src" directive to mitigate this weakness. Both directives allow for the placement of restrictions when it comes to allowing embedded content.</Description>

      <Weakness ID="1022" Name="Use of Web Link to Untrusted Target with window.opener Access" Abstraction="Variant" Structure="Simple" Status="Incomplete">
         <Description>The web application produces links to untrusted external sites outside of its sphere of control, but it does not properly prevent the external site from modifying security-critical properties of the window.opener object, such as the location property.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>When a user clicks a link to an external site ("target"), the target="_blank" attribute causes the target site's contents to be opened in a new window or tab, which runs in the same process as the original page. The window.opener object records information about the original page that offered the link.  If an attacker can run script on the target page, then they could read or modify certain properties of the window.opener object, including the location property - even if the original and target site are not the same origin.  An attacker can modify the location property to automatically redirect the user to a malicious site, e.g. as part of a phishing attack. Since this redirect happens in the original window/tab - which is not necessarily visible, since the browser is focusing the display on the new target page - the user might not notice any suspicious redirection.</Extended_Description>

             <Description>Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input) with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)</Description>

         <Demonstrative_Examples>
            <Demonstrative_Example>
               <Intro_Text>In this example, the application opens a link in a named window/tab without taking precautions to prevent the called page from tampering with the calling page's location in the browser.</Intro_Text>
               <Body_Text>There are two ways that this weakness is commonly seen. The first is when the application generates an &lt;a&gt; tag is with target="_blank" to point to a target site:</Body_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="Bad" Language="HTML">
                  <xhtml:div>&lt;a href="http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html" target="_blank"&gt;</xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>If the attacker offers a useful page on this link (or compromises a trusted, popular site), then a user may click on this link.  However, the attacker could use scripting code to modify the window.opener's location property to redirect the application to a malicious, attacker-controlled page - such as one that mimics the look and feel of the original application and convinces the user to re-enter authentication credentials, i.e. phishing:</Body_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="Attack" Language="JavaScript">
                  <xhtml:div>window.opener.location = 'http://phishing.example.org/popular-bank-page';</xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>To mitigate this type of weakness, some browsers support the "rel" attribute with a value of "noopener", which sets the window.opener object equal to null. Another option is to use the "rel" attribute with a value of "noreferrer", which in essence does the same thing.</Body_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="Good" Language="HTML">
                  <xhtml:div>&lt;a href="http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;</xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>A second way that this weakness is commonly seen is when opening a new site directly within JavaScript. In this case, a new site is opened using the window.open() function.</Body_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="Bad" Language="JavaScript">
                  <xhtml:div>var newWindow = window.open("http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html", "_blank");</xhtml:div>
               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>To mitigate this, set the window.opener object to null.</Body_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="Good" Language="JavaScript">
                  <xhtml:div>var newWindow = window.open("http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html", "_blank");<xhtml:br/>newWindow.opener = null;</xhtml:div>

         <Background_Details>
            <Background_Detail>The Struts Validator uses a form's validate() method to check the contents of the form properties against the constraints specified in the associated validation form. That means the following classes have a validate() method that is part of the validation framework: ValidatorForm, ValidatorActionForm, DynaValidatorForm, and DynaValidatorActionForm. If the code creates a class that extends one of these classes, and if that class implements custom validation logic by overriding the validate() method, the code must call super.validate() in the validate() implementation.</Background_Detail>

               <Impact>Varies by Context</Impact>
               <Note>If the code does not call super.validate(), the Validation Framework cannot check the contents of the form against a validation form. In other words, the validation framework will be disabled for the given form. Disabling the validation framework for a form exposes the product to numerous types of attacks.</Note>

             <Description>Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input) with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)</Description>

            <Demonstrative_Example>
               <Intro_Text>In the following Java example the class RegistrationForm is a Struts framework ActionForm Bean that will maintain user input data from a registration webpage for an online business site. The user will enter registration data and the RegistrationForm bean in the Struts framework will maintain the user data. Tthe RegistrationForm class implements the validate method to validate the user input entered into the form.</Intro_Text>

               <Body_Text>Although the validate method is implemented in this example the method does not call the validate method of the ValidatorForm parent class with a call super.validate(). Without the call to the parent validator class only the custom validation will be performed and the default validation will not be performed. The following example shows that the validate method of the ValidatorForm class is called within the implementation of the validate method.</Body_Text>

            <Demonstrative_Example Demonstrative_Example_ID="DX-200">
              <Intro_Text>The following code reads a password from the
              user, uses the password to connect to a back-end
              mainframe, and then attempts to scrub the password from
              memory using memset().</Intro_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="Bad" Language="C">
				 void GetData(char *MFAddr) {
				 <xhtml:div style="margin-left:1em;">
				   char pwd[64];<xhtml:br/>
				   if (GetPasswordFromUser(pwd, sizeof(pwd))) {
				   <xhtml:div style="margin-left:1em;">
					 if (ConnectToMainframe(MFAddr, pwd)) {
					 <xhtml:div style="margin-left:1em;">
					   <xhtml:i>// Interaction with mainframe</xhtml:i>
					 </xhtml:div>
					 }
				   </xhtml:div>
				   }<xhtml:br/>
				   memset(pwd, 0, sizeof(pwd));
                 </xhtml:div>
				 }
               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>The code in the example will behave
               correctly if it is executed verbatim, but if the code
               is compiled using an optimizing compiler, then the call to
               memset() might be removed as a dead store, because the
               buffer pwd is not used after its value is overwritten.
               Because the buffer pwd contains a sensitive
               value, the application may be vulnerable to attack if
               the data are left memory resident. If attackers are
               able to access the correct region of memory, they may
               use the recovered password to gain control of the
               system.</Body_Text>
               <Body_Text>It is common practice to overwrite sensitive
               data manipulated in memory, such as passwords or
               cryptographic keys, in order to prevent attackers from
               learning system secrets. However, with the advent of
               optimizing compilers, programs do not always behave as
               their source code alone would suggest. In the example,
               the compiler interprets the call to memset() as dead
               code because the memory being written to is not
               subsequently used, despite the fact that there is
               clearly a security motivation for the operation to
               occur. The problem here is that many compilers, and in
               fact many programming languages, do not take this and
               other security concerns into consideration in their
               efforts to improve efficiency.</Body_Text>
               <Body_Text>Attackers typically exploit this type of
               vulnerability by using a core dump or runtime mechanism
               to access the memory used by a particular application
               and recover the secret information. Once an attacker
               has access to the secret information, it is relatively
               straightforward to further exploit the system and
               possibly compromise other resources with which the
               application interacts.</Body_Text>

      <Weakness ID="1039" Name="Inadequate Detection or Handling of Adversarial Input Perturbations in Automated Recognition Mechanism" Abstraction="Class" Structure="Simple" Status="Incomplete">
         <Description>The product uses an automated mechanism such as machine learning to recognize complex data inputs (e.g. image or audio) as a particular concept or category, but it does not properly detect or handle inputs that have been modified or constructed in a way that causes the mechanism to detect a different, incorrect concept.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>
            <xhtml:p>When techniques such as machine learning are used to automatically classify input streams, and those classifications are used for security-critical decisions, then any mistake in classification can introduce a vulnerability that allows attackers to cause the product to make the wrong security decision or disrupt service of the automated mechanism.  If the mechanism is not developed or "trained" with enough input data or has not adequately undergone test and evaluation, then attackers may be able to craft malicious inputs that intentionally trigger the incorrect classification.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Targeted technologies include, but are not necessarily limited to:</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>automated speech recognition</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>automated image recognition</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>automated cyber defense</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>Chatbot, LLMs, generative AI</xhtml:li>
            </xhtml:ul>
            <xhtml:p>For example, an attacker might modify road signs or road surface markings to trick autonomous vehicles into misreading the sign/marking and performing a dangerous action. Another example includes an attacker that crafts highly specific and complex prompts to "jailbreak" a chatbot to bypass safety or privacy mechanisms, better known as prompt injection attacks.</xhtml:p>

            <Comments>This entry is classified in a part of CWE's hierarchy that does not have sufficiently low-level coverage, which might reflect a lack of classification-oriented weakness research in the software security community. Conduct careful root cause analysis to determine the original mistake that led to this weakness. If closer analysis reveals that this weakness is appropriate, then this might be the best available CWE to use for mapping. If no other option is available, then it is acceptable to map to this CWE.</Comments>

         <Background_Details>
            <Background_Detail>In order to use the Struts Validator, a form must extend one of the following: ValidatorForm, ValidatorActionForm, DynaValidatorActionForm, and DynaValidatorForm. One of these classes must be extended because the Struts Validator ties in to the application by implementing the validate() method in these classes. Forms derived from the ActionForm and DynaActionForm classes cannot use the Struts Validator.</Background_Detail>

             <Description>Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input) with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)</Description>

               <Intro_Text>In the following Java example the class RegistrationForm is a Struts framework ActionForm Bean that will maintain user information from a registration webpage for an online business site. The user will enter registration data and through the Struts framework the RegistrationForm bean will maintain the user data.</Intro_Text>
               <Example_Code Nature="Bad" Language="Java">
                  <xhtml:div>public class RegistrationForm extends org.apache.struts.action.ActionForm {<xhtml:br/>
                     <xhtml:div style="margin-left:1em;">
                        <xhtml:div>// private variables for registration form<xhtml:br/>private String name;<xhtml:br/>private String email;<xhtml:br/>...<xhtml:br/>

               </Example_Code>
               <Body_Text>However, the RegistrationForm class extends the Struts ActionForm class which does not allow the RegistrationForm class to use the Struts validator capabilities. When using the Struts framework to maintain user data in an ActionForm Bean, the class should always extend one of the validator classes, ValidatorForm, ValidatorActionForm, DynaValidatorForm or DynaValidatorActionForm. These validator classes provide default validation and the validate method for custom validation for the Bean object to use for validating input data. The following Java example shows the RegistrationForm class extending the ValidatorForm class and implementing the validate method for validating input data.</Body_Text>

                  <xhtml:div>public class RegistrationForm extends org.apache.struts.validator.ValidatorForm {<xhtml:br/>

Although J2EE applications are not generally susceptible to memory corruption attacks, if a J2EE application interfaces with native code that does not perform array bounds checking, an attacker may be able to use an input validation mistake in the J2EE application to launch a buffer overflow attack.</Extended_Description>

            <Demonstrative_Example>
               <Intro_Text>In the following example the Java class RegistrationForm is a Struts framework ActionForm Bean that will maintain user input data from a registration webpage for an online business site. The user will enter registration data and, through the Struts framework, the RegistrationForm bean will maintain the user data in the form fields using the private member variables. The RegistrationForm class uses the Struts validation capability by extending the ValidatorForm class and including the validation for the form fields within the validator XML file, validator.xml.</Intro_Text>

               <Body_Text>The validator XML file, validator.xml, provides the validation for the form fields of the RegistrationForm.</Body_Text>

In the most benign case, an attacker may be able to insert false entries into the log file by providing the application with input that includes appropriate characters. Forged or otherwise corrupted log files can be used to cover an attacker's tracks, possibly by skewing statistics, or even to implicate another party in the commission of a malicious act. If the log file is processed automatically, the attacker can render the file unusable by corrupting the format of the file or injecting unexpected characters. An attacker may inject code or other commands into the log file and take advantage of a vulnerability in the log processing utility.</Note>

               <Description>
                  <xhtml:p>Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs.  This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.</xhtml:p>

               <Description>Use and specify an output encoding that can be handled by the downstream component that is reading the output. Common encodings include ISO-8859-1, UTF-7, and UTF-8. When an encoding is not specified, a downstream component may choose a different encoding, either by assuming a default encoding or automatically inferring which encoding is being used, which can be erroneous. When the encodings are inconsistent, the downstream component might treat some character or byte sequences as special, even if they are not special in the original encoding. Attackers might then be able to exploit this discrepancy and conduct injection attacks; they even might be able to bypass protection mechanisms that assume the original encoding is also being used by the downstream component.</Description>

               <Description>Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180). Make sure that the application does not decode the same input twice (CWE-174). Such errors could be used to bypass allowlist validation schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked.</Description>

               <Body_Text>If a user submits the string "twenty-one" for val, the following entry is logged:</Body_Text>

      <Weakness ID="1173" Name="Improper Use of Validation Framework" Abstraction="Base" Structure="Simple" Status="Draft">
         <Description>The product does not use, or incorrectly uses, an input validation framework that is provided by the source language or an independent library.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>Many modern coding languages provide developers with input validation frameworks to make the task of input validation easier and less error-prone. These frameworks will automatically check all input against specified criteria and direct execution to error handlers when invalid input is received. The improper use (i.e., an incorrect implementation or missing altogether) of these frameworks is not directly exploitable, but can lead to an exploitable condition if proper input validation is not performed later in the product. Not using provided input validation frameworks can also hurt the maintainability of code as future developers may not recognize the downstream input validation being used in the place of the validation framework.</Extended_Description>

                  <xhtml:p>A static analysis tool might allow the user to specify which application-specific methods or functions perform input validation; the tool might also have built-in knowledge of validation frameworks such as Struts.

                  <xhtml:p>Except in the cases described in the previous paragraph, automated static analysis might not be able to recognize when proper input validation is being performed, leading to false positives - i.e., warnings that do not have any security consequences or require any code changes.</xhtml:p>

      <Weakness ID="1204" Name="Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV)" Abstraction="Base" Structure="Simple" Status="Incomplete">
			<Description>The product uses a cryptographic primitive that uses an Initialization
			Vector (IV), but the product does not generate IVs that are
			sufficiently unpredictable or unique according to the expected
			cryptographic requirements for that primitive.
			</Description>
			<Extended_Description>
			  By design, some cryptographic primitives
			  (such as block ciphers) require that IVs
			  must have certain properties for the
			  uniqueness and/or unpredictability of an
			  IV. Primitives may vary in how important
			  these properties are. If these properties
			  are not maintained, e.g. by a bug in the
			  code, then the cryptography may be weakened
			  or broken by attacking the IVs themselves.

			    <Method>Automated Static Analysis</Method>
			    <Description>Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input) with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)</Description>

			    <Description><xhtml:p>Different cipher
			    modes have different requirements for
			    their IVs. When choosing and implementing
			    a mode, it is important to understand
			    those requirements in order to keep
			    security guarantees intact. Generally, it
			    is safest to generate a random IV, since
			    it will be both unpredictable and have a
			    very low chance of being non-unique. IVs
			    do not have to be kept secret, so if
			    generating duplicate IVs is a concern, a
			    list of already-used IVs can be kept and
			    checked against.
			    </xhtml:p>
			    <xhtml:p>
			      NIST offers recommendations on generation of IVs for modes of which they have approved. These include options for when random IVs are not practical. For CBC, CFB, and OFB, see [REF-1175]; for GCM, see [REF-1178].

			  <Demonstrative_Example>
			    <Intro_Text>
			    The Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) protocol used in the 802.11
			    wireless standard only supported 40-bit keys, and the IVs were only 24
			    bits, increasing the chances that the same IV would be reused for
			    multiple messages. The IV was included in plaintext as part of the packet, making
			    it directly observable to attackers. Only 5000 messages are needed
			    before a collision occurs due to the "birthday paradox" [REF-1176]. Some
			    implementations would reuse the same IV for each packet. This IV reuse
			    made it much easier for attackers to recover plaintext from
			    two packets with the same IV, using well-understood attacks,
			    especially if the plaintext was known for one of the packets [REF-1175].

			<Notes>
			  <Note Type="Maintenance">As of CWE 4.5, terminology related to randomness, entropy, and
			  predictability can vary widely. Within the developer and other
			  communities, "randomness" is used heavily. However, within
			  cryptography, "entropy" is distinct, typically implied as a
			  measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within
			  standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of
			  CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary,
			  distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for
			  different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for
			  mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.</Note>

      <Weakness ID="121" Name="Stack-based Buffer Overflow" Abstraction="Variant" Structure="Simple" Status="Draft">
         <Description>A stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).</Description>

         <Background_Details>
            <Background_Detail>There are generally several security-critical data on an execution stack that can lead to arbitrary code execution. The most prominent is the stored return address, the memory address at which execution should continue once the current function is finished executing. The attacker can overwrite this value with some memory address to which the attacker also has write access, into which they place arbitrary code to be run with the full privileges of the vulnerable program. Alternately, the attacker can supply the address of an important call, for instance the POSIX system() call, leaving arguments to the call on the stack. This is often called a return into libc exploit, since the attacker generally forces the program to jump at return time into an interesting routine in the C standard library (libc). Other important data commonly on the stack include the stack pointer and frame pointer, two values that indicate offsets for computing memory addresses. Modifying those values can often be leveraged into a "write-what-where" condition.</Background_Detail>

               <Description>"Stack Overflow" is often used to mean the same thing as stack-based buffer overflow, however it is also used on occasion to mean stack exhaustion, usually a result from an excessively recursive function call. Due to the ambiguity of the term, use of stack overflow to describe either circumstance is discouraged.</Description>

             <Method>Fuzzing</Method>
             <Description>Fuzz testing (fuzzing) is a powerful technique for generating large numbers of diverse inputs - either randomly or algorithmically - and dynamically invoking the code with those inputs. Even with random inputs, it is often capable of generating unexpected results such as crashes, memory corruption, or resource consumption. Fuzzing effectively produces repeatable test cases that clearly indicate bugs, which helps developers to diagnose the issues.</Description>

             <Description>Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input) with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)</Description>

	       <Description>
		 <xhtml:p>Run or compile the software using features or extensions that randomly arrange the positions of a program's executable and libraries in memory. Because this makes the addresses unpredictable, it can prevent an attacker from reliably jumping to exploitable code. </xhtml:p> 
		 <xhtml:p> Examples include Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) [REF-58] [REF-60] and Position-Independent Executables (PIE) [REF-64]. Imported modules may be similarly realigned if their default memory addresses conflict with other modules, in a process known as "rebasing" (for Windows) and "prelinking" (for Linux) [REF-1332] using randomly generated addresses. ASLR for libraries cannot be used in conjunction with prelink since it would require relocating the libraries at run-time, defeating the whole purpose of prelinking. </xhtml:p> 
	       <xhtml:p> For more information on these techniques see D3-SAOR (Segment Address Offset Randomization) from D3FEND [REF-1335]. </xhtml:p> </Description> 
	       <Effectiveness>Defense in Depth</Effectiveness> 
	       <Effectiveness_Notes>These techniques do not provide a complete solution.  For instance, exploits frequently use a bug that discloses memory addresses in order to maximize reliability of code execution [REF-1337]. It has also been shown that a side-channel attack can bypass ASLR [REF-1333].</Effectiveness_Notes>

	   <Note Type="Terminology">There is significant inconsistency
	   regarding the "buffer overflow" term, which can have
	   multiple interpretations and uses. Many people mean
	   "writing past the end of a buffer."  Others mean "writing

Besides important user data, heap-based overflows can be used to overwrite function pointers that may be living in memory, pointing it to the attacker's code. Even in applications that do not explicitly use function pointers, the run-time will usually leave many in memory. For example, object methods in C++ are generally implemented using function pointers. Even in C programs, there is often a global offset table used by the underlying runtime.</Note>

             <Description>Fuzz testing (fuzzing) is a powerful technique for generating large numbers of diverse inputs - either randomly or algorithmically - and dynamically invoking the code with those inputs. Even with random inputs, it is often capable of generating unexpected results such as crashes, memory corruption, or resource consumption. Fuzzing effectively produces repeatable test cases that clearly indicate bugs, which helps developers to diagnose the issues.</Description>

	       <Description>
		 <xhtml:p>Run or compile the software using features or extensions that randomly arrange the positions of a program's executable and libraries in memory. Because this makes the addresses unpredictable, it can prevent an attacker from reliably jumping to exploitable code. </xhtml:p> 
		 <xhtml:p> Examples include Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) [REF-58] [REF-60] and Position-Independent Executables (PIE) [REF-64]. Imported modules may be similarly realigned if their default memory addresses conflict with other modules, in a process known as "rebasing" (for Windows) and "prelinking" (for Linux) [REF-1332] using randomly generated addresses. ASLR for libraries cannot be used in conjunction with prelink since it would require relocating the libraries at run-time, defeating the whole purpose of prelinking. </xhtml:p> 
		 <xhtml:p> For more information on these techniques see D3-SAOR (Segment Address Offset Randomization) from D3FEND [REF-1335]. </xhtml:p>

	       <Effectiveness>Defense in Depth</Effectiveness> 
	       <Effectiveness_Notes>These techniques do not provide a complete solution.  For instance, exploits frequently use a bug that discloses memory addresses in order to maximize reliability of code execution [REF-1337]. It has also been shown that a side-channel attack can bypass ASLR [REF-1333].</Effectiveness_Notes>

            <Rationale>This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.</Rationale>
            <Comments>Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.</Comments>

         <Notes>
	   <Note Type="Terminology">There is significant inconsistency
	   regarding the "buffer overflow" term, which can have
	   multiple interpretations and uses. Many people mean
	   "writing past the end of a buffer."  Others mean "writing
	   past the end of a buffer, or before the beginning of a
	   buffer."  Still others might include "read" in the term.</Note>

      </Weakness>
      <Weakness ID="1220" Name="Insufficient Granularity of Access Control" Abstraction="Base" Structure="Simple" Status="Incomplete">
            <Description>The product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.</Description>
            <Extended_Description>
                <xhtml:p>Integrated circuits and hardware engines can expose accesses to assets (device configuration, keys, etc.) to trusted firmware or a software module (commonly set by BIOS/bootloader). This access is typically access-controlled. Upon a power reset, the hardware or system usually starts with default values in registers, and the trusted firmware (Boot firmware) configures the necessary access-control protection.</xhtml:p>
                <xhtml:p>A common weakness that can exist in such protection schemes is that access controls or policies are not granular enough. This condition allows agents beyond trusted agents to access assets and could lead to a loss of functionality or the ability to set up the device securely. This further results in security risks from leaked, sensitive, key material to modification of device configuration.</xhtml:p>

                        <xhtml:p>Consider a system with a register for storing AES key for encryption or decryption. The key is 128 bits, implemented as a set of four 32-bit registers. The key registers are assets and registers, AES_KEY_READ_POLICY and AES_KEY_WRITE_POLICY, and are defined to provide necessary access controls.</xhtml:p>
                        <xhtml:p>The read-policy register defines which agents can read the AES-key registers, and write-policy register defines which agents can program or write to those registers. Each register is a 32-bit register, and it can support access control for a maximum of 32 agents. The number of the bit when set (i.e., "1") allows respective action from an agent whose identity matches the number of the bit and, if "0" (i.e., Clear), disallows the respective action to that corresponding agent.</xhtml:p>

                    <Body_Text>A good design should be granular enough to provide separate access controls to separate actions. Access control for reads should be separate from writes.

The policy is defined such that: the AES-key registers can only be read or used by a crypto agent with identity "1" when bit #1 is set.

                        <xhtml:p>Within the AXI node interface wrapper module in the RISC-V AXI module of the HACK@DAC'19 CVA6 SoC [REF-1346], an access control mechanism is employed to regulate the access of different privileged users to peripherals.</xhtml:p>
                    </Intro_Text>
                    <Body_Text>The AXI ensures that only users with appropriate privileges can access specific peripherals. For instance, a ROM module is accessible exclusively with Machine privilege, and AXI enforces that users attempting to read data from the ROM must possess machine privilege; otherwise, access to the ROM is denied. The access control information and configurations are stored in a ROM.</Body_Text>

                    <Body_Text>However, in the example code above, while assigning distinct privileges to AXI manager and subordinates, both the Platform-Level Interrupt Controller Specification (PLIC) and the Core-local Interrupt Controller (CLINT) (which are peripheral numbers 6 and 7 respectively) utilize the same access control configuration. This common configuration diminishes the granularity of the AXI access control mechanism.</Body_Text>
                    <Body_Text>In certain situations, it might be necessary to grant higher privileges for accessing the PLIC than those required for accessing the CLINT. Unfortunately, this differentiation is overlooked, allowing an attacker to access the PLIC with lower privileges than intended.</Body_Text>
                    <Body_Text>As a consequence, unprivileged code can read and write to the PLIC even when it was not intended to do so. In the worst-case scenario, the attacker could manipulate interrupt priorities, potentially modifying the system's behavior or availability.</Body_Text>
                    <Body_Text>To address the aforementioned vulnerability, developers must enhance the AXI access control granularity by implementing distinct access control entries for the Platform-Level Interrupt Controller (PLIC) and the Core-local Interrupt Controller (CLINT). By doing so, different privilege levels can be defined for accessing PLIC and CLINT, effectively thwarting the potential attacks previously highlighted. This approach ensures a more robust and secure system, safeguarding against unauthorized access and manipulation of interrupt priorities. [REF-1347]</Body_Text>

	      both read and write access. Address 0xA0000000 - 0xA000FFFF is readable and writable
	      by the untrusted cores core{0-N} and address 0xA0010000 - 0xA001FFFF is only

	    <xhtml:p>
	      The security policy access control is not granular enough, as it uses one bit to enable both
	      read and write access. This gives write access to an area that should only be readable
	      by unprivileged agents.

	      Access control logic should differentiate between read and write access and to have

            <Rationale>This CWE entry is a Class, but it does not have Base-level children.</Rationale>
            <Comments>This entry is classified in a part of CWE's hierarchy that does not have sufficiently low-level coverage, which might reflect a lack of classification-oriented weakness research in the software security community. Conduct careful root cause analysis to determine the original mistake that led to this weakness. If closer analysis reveals that this weakness is appropriate, then this might be the best available CWE to use for mapping. If no other option is available, then it is acceptable to map to this CWE.</Comments>

            <Note Type="Relationship">Note that there is a close relationship between this weakness and CWE-603 (Use of Client-Side Authentication). If developers do not believe that a user can reverse engineer a client, then they are more likely to choose client-side authentication in the belief that it is safe.</Note>

               <Intro_Text>Switches may revert their functionality to that of hubs when the table used to map ARP information to the switch interface overflows, such as when under a spoofing attack. This results in traffic being broadcast to an eavesdropper, instead of being sent only on the relevant switch interface. To mitigate this type of problem, the developer could limit the number of ARP entries that can be recorded for a given switch interface, while other interfaces may keep functioning normally. Configuration options can be provided on the appropriate actions to be taken in case of a detected failure, but safe defaults should be used.</Intro_Text>

      <Weakness ID="66" Name="Improper Handling of File Names that Identify Virtual Resources" Abstraction="Base" Structure="Simple" Status="Draft">
         <Description>The product does not handle or incorrectly handles a file name that identifies a "virtual" resource that is not directly specified within the directory that is associated with the file name, causing the product to perform file-based operations on a resource that is not a file.</Description>
         <Extended_Description>Virtual file names are represented like normal file names, but they are effectively aliases for other resources that do not behave like normal files. Depending on their functionality, they could be alternate entities. They are not necessarily listed in directories.</Extended_Description>

      <Weakness ID="662" Name="Improper Synchronization" Abstraction="Class" Structure="Simple" Status="Draft">
         <Description>The product utilizes multiple threads, processes, components, or systems to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes.</Description>
	 <Extended_Description>
	   <xhtml:p>Synchronization refers to a variety of behaviors and mechanisms that allow two or more independently-operating processes or threads to ensure that they operate on shared resources in predictable ways that do not interfere with each other.  Some shared resource operations cannot be executed atomically; that is, multiple steps must be guaranteed to execute sequentially, without any interference by other processes.  Synchronization mechanisms vary widely, but they may include locking, mutexes, and semaphores.  When a multi-step operation on a shared resource cannot be guaranteed to execute independent of interference, then the resulting behavior can be unpredictable. Improper synchronization could lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.</xhtml:p>

	     <Method>Automated Static Analysis</Method>
	     <Description>Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input) with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)</Description>

      <Category ID="1006" Name="Bad Coding Practices" Status="Draft">
         <Summary>Weaknesses in this category are related to coding practices that are deemed unsafe and increase the chances that an exploitable vulnerability will be present in the application. These weaknesses do not directly introduce a vulnerability, but indicate that the product has not been carefully developed or maintained. If a program is complex, difficult to maintain, not portable, or shows evidence of neglect, then there is a higher likelihood that weaknesses are buried in the code.</Summary>

         <Notes>
            <Note Type="Other">This view uses a deep hierarchical organization, with more levels of abstraction than other classification schemes. The top-level entries are called Pillars. Where possible, this view uses abstractions that do not consider particular languages, frameworks, technologies, life cycle development phases, frequency of occurrence, or types of resources. It explicitly identifies relationships that form chains and composites, which have not been a formal part of past classification efforts. Chains and composites might help explain why mutual exclusivity is difficult to achieve within security error taxonomies. This view is roughly aligned with MITRE's research into vulnerability theory, especially with respect to behaviors and resources. Ideally, this view will only cover weakness-to-weakness relationships, with minimal overlap and zero categories.  It is expected to include at least one parent/child relationship for every weakness within CWE.</Note>

      <View ID="1400" Name="Comprehensive Categorization for Software Assurance Trends" Type="Graph" Status="Draft">
         <Objective>
	   <xhtml:p>This view organizes weaknesses around categories that are of interest to large-scale software assurance research to support the elimination of weaknesses using tactics such as secure language development. It is also intended to help tracking weakness trends in publicly disclosed vulnerability data.  This view is comprehensive in that every weakness must be contained in it, unlike most other views that only use a subset of weaknesses. This view is structured with categories at the top level, with a second level of only weaknesses. Relationships among the weaknesses presented under the research view (CWE-1000) are not shown.</xhtml:p>
	   <xhtml:p>Each weakness is added to only one category. All categories are mutually exclusive; that is, no weakness can be a member of more than one category. While weaknesses defy strict categorization along only one characteristic, the forced bucketing into a single category can simplify certain kinds of analysis.</xhtml:p>
	   <xhtml:p>Note that the size of each category can vary widely because (1) CWE is not as well fleshed-out in some areas compared to others; (2) abstraction of the CWEs in the grouping might go down to Variant level for some buckets, versus others.</xhtml:p>

	   <Note Type="Relationship">This view is different than the software development view (CWE-699) because this view is expected to include all weaknesses regardless of abstraction, while view 699 uses a largely-fixed Base level of abstraction related only to software weaknesses. It is different from the Research view (CWE-1000) because while comprehensive for all weaknesses, the view uses a deep hierarchical structure and excludes categories.</Note>

      <View ID="1432" Name="Weaknesses in the 2025 CWE Most Important Hardware Weaknesses List" Type="Graph" Status="Stable">
            <Objective>CWE entries in this view are listed in
            the 2025 CWE Most Important Hardware Weaknesses List, as
            determined by the Hardware CWE Special Interest Group (HW
            CWE SIG). The 2025 MIHW aims to drive awareness of
            critical hardware weaknesses and provide the cybersecurity
            community with practical guidance to prevent security
            issues at the source. By combining advanced data analysis
            with expert consensus, the list helps organizations
            prioritize mitigations, strengthen design practices, and
            make informed decisions throughout the hardware
            lifecycle.

	   <Note Type="Maintenance">As of CWE 4.19, the relationships in this view were pulled directly from the CWE mappings cited in the 2025 OWASP Top Ten RC1. These mappings include categories and high-level weaknesses. One mapping to a deprecated entry was removed. The CWE Program will work with OWASP to improve these mappings, possibly requiring modifications to CWE itself.</Note>
