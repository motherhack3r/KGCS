## Executive Summary

KGCS has completed Phase 1 (frozen core ontologies) and Phase 2 (SHACL validation framework). Phase 3 ETL transforms raw data for all core standards (including CAR) and validates via parallel SHACL streaming with summary reports. The Neo4j loader now supports label-aware relationship inserts with per-label `uri` indexes and can load a combined TTL for cross-standard relationships. End-to-end Neo4j loads have been verified locally with full standard outputs; CI ingestion gates remain pending. Phases 4–5 are designed but not implemented. Critical path remains Phase 3 MVP (CI + repeatable end-to-end validation).

## Critical Path

Phase 3 MVP completion requires:

1. Relationship breakdown reporting in loader final stats

**Estimated timeline:** 6-10 days to production-ready Neo4j load with full CPE/CVE coverage. Phase 4–5 can begin in parallel (extension ETL, RAG framework).

**Blocker Status:** ✅ **CLEARED** — Core standards including CAR validated with 0 violations. Ready for Neo4j integration.

## Phase 3 “Definition of Done” (Tight Checklist)

- [x] CAR raw YAML → Turtle ETL implemented and SHACL validation passes (downloaded analytics/sensors).
- [x] Single combined or per-standard pipeline outputs load into Neo4j using [src/etl/rdf_to_neo4j.py](src/etl/rdf_to_neo4j.py) without errors.
- [x] Neo4j constraints/indexes applied and verified (core IDs unique: cpeNameId, matchCriteriaId, cveId, cweId, capecId, attackTechniqueId, d3fendId, carId, shieldId, engageId).
- [x] End-to-end test: ETL → SHACL → Neo4j load executed and passes on pipeline TTLs in tmp/.
- [x] CI job added to run Phase 3 ingestion smoke checks and publish artifacts.

### Acceptance Tests (Measurable)

- CAR ETL: Running `python -m src.etl.etl_car --input data/car/raw --output tmp/pipeline-stage8-car.ttl --validate` produces a Turtle file and a SHACL report with `conforms: true`.
- Neo4j load: Running `python src/etl/rdf_to_neo4j.py --ttl tmp/pipeline-stage1-cpe.ttl --batch-size 1000` completes with success banner and no exceptions.
- Constraints: After load, `MATCH (n:Platform) RETURN count(n)` and `SHOW CONSTRAINTS` confirm uniqueness constraints exist for core IDs.
- End-to-end: Running `python scripts/validate_etl_pipeline_order.py --load-neo4j --batch-size 1000` loads combined pipeline TTLs and results in a non-empty graph (nodes and relationships) with no load errors.
- CI: A workflow run uploads artifacts for SHACL summaries and logs, and fails the job if any summary report has `conforms: false`.

## Update Summary

- **Date:** January 28, 2026  
- **Overall Status:** Phase 1 ✅ Complete | Phase 2 ✅ Complete | Phase 3 🟢 In Progress (MVP) | Phase 4 🔵 Designed | Phase 5 🔵 Planned  

### Recent Developments

- **Raw-to-Turtle ETL:** CAR analytics + sensors YAML downloaded and validated to Turtle.  
- **SHACL Validation:** Parallel streaming validation completed with per-standard summary reports.  
- **CPEMatch Fix:** `Platform` nodes now emit `cpeNameId` and correct `cpeUri`, and CPEMatch validation conforms (0 violations).  
- **Repo Hygiene:** Removed oversized CPEMatch summary report from history; added ignore rule to prevent reintroduction.  
- **Neo4j Loader:** Label-aware relationship inserts + per-label `uri` indexes for faster loads; combined TTL load verified locally.  
- **Neo4j Constraints:** Core-ID uniqueness constraints applied and verified in a live DB (local).  
- **Download Pipeline:** Daily downloader runs cleanly with fixed raw-path handling and no duplicate downloads.  
- **CI Ingestion Smoke:** Workflow added in [.github/workflows/phase3-ingest-smoke.yml](.github/workflows/phase3-ingest-smoke.yml) to run sample ETL + validate artifacts.  
- **Cross-standard Relationships:** CAPEC→ATT&CK (`implements`) and CVE→CWE (`caused_by`) now emitted by ETL and loaded into Neo4j.  
- **CWE/CAPEC Coverage:** Additional CWE/CAPEC relationship types (peer/sequence/alternate) now emitted.  
- **End-to-end Tests:** Full ETL → SHACL → Neo4j test suite implemented using pipeline outputs.  

### Next Steps (Phase 3 Completion Order)

1. Add relationship breakdown reporting (by label and type) to loader final stats.  
2. Add CI gating for full pipeline outputs and Neo4j smoke load (optional, if runtime permits).

### Post-MVP Roadmap Note

- Cloud migration planning is deferred until after Phase 3 MVP completion (or later if needed).
