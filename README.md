# KGCS – Cybersecurity Knowledge Graph

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2026  

---

## 📌 Overview

KGCS (Cybersecurity Knowledge Graph) is a frozen, standards‑backed ontology that unifies nine MITRE security taxonomies (CVE, CWE, CPE, CVSS, CAPEC, ATT&CK, D3FEND, CAR, SHIELD, ENGAGE).  
It provides a single source of truth for AI systems to reason about vulnerabilities, attacks, defenses, and threat intelligence without hallucination.

## 🏗️ Architecture

```text
┌───────────────────────┐
│  Extension Layer (L4)  │  (Incident, Risk, ThreatActor)
├───────────────────────┤
│  Core Ontology (L3)    │  (CPE → CVE → CWE → CAPEC → ATT&CK → D3FEND/CAR/SHIELD/ENGAGE)
├───────────────────────┤
│  Modular Ontologies    │  (one OWL file per standard)
├───────────────────────┤
│  External Standards    │  (NVD, MITRE)
└───────────────────────┘
```

* **Core** is immutable and 1:1 mapped to official JSON/STIX schemas.  
* **Extensions** add temporal, contextual, or subjective data without polluting the core.

## 🔑 Core Invariants

| Invariant | Description |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| Authoritative alignment | Every class/property maps to a stable ID in NVD or MITRE. |
| Explicit provenance | Every edge is traceable to a source field. |
| No invented semantics | The ontology is a lens, not a replacement for the standards. |
| Extensions never modify core | Incident, Risk, ThreatActor layers reference core only. |

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**  

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourorg/kgcs.git
   cd kgcs
   ```

2. **Load data**  
   * Download NVD and MITRE JSON/STIX files into data.  
   * Run the ingestion script (Python/Neo4j or RDF).  

3. **Query the graph**  
   * Use Neo4j Cypher or SPARQL.  
   * Example:  

     ```cypher
     MATCH (cve:Vulnerability {cveId:'CVE-2025-1234'})
     MATCH (cve)-[:caused_by]->(cwe:CWE)
     RETURN cve, cwe
     ```

4. **Integrate with RAG**  
   * Use the pre‑approved traversal templates in rag.  
   * Ensure LLM queries follow a template; otherwise reject.

## 📦 Extensions

* **Incident** – Observed techniques, detections, evidence.  
* **Risk** – Assessments, scenarios, decisions.  
* **ThreatActor** – Attribution claims, capabilities, tools.

Each extension lives in its own OWL file and imports the core ontology.

## 📈 Future Work

* Add new standards (e.g., NIST SP 800‑53).  
* SHACL validation: canonical shapes, per-OWL bundles and manifest, validator CLI (`--template` / `--owl`) implemented; ETL integration and governance artifacts added. Validator emits machine-readable reports to `artifacts/` and a consolidated index `artifacts/shacl-report-consolidated.json`. CI gating remains scaffolded and requires rule‑ID policy selection.
* Build a UI for visualizing traversal paths.  
* Integrate with an LLM for explainable answers.

## 🧰 Operational Scripts

* `scripts/db/` holds the Phase 4 helpers (`create_cpe_cve_relationships.py`, `verify_phase4_complete.py`, the `check_*` utilities, etc.) that interact with Neo4j for reproduction or diagnostics.  
* `scripts/legacy/phase4/` archives the one-off repair/verification scripts (`repair_cpe_properties.py`, `diagnose_cpe_mismatch.py`, `check_buggy_pattern.py`, etc.) that were needed during the CPE parsing fix but are no longer part of normal ingestion.
* Regression and integration suites now live under `tests/` so the repository root stays focused on documentation, configuration, and operational scripts.

### Verification Utilities (RDF/Turtle)

* [tests/verify_causal_chain.py](tests/verify_causal_chain.py) — offline sanity check of CWE→CAPEC→Technique→Tactic using the pipeline Turtle outputs in tmp.
* [tests/verify_defense_layers.py](tests/verify_defense_layers.py) — offline sanity check of defense-layer links (D3FEND/CAR/SHIELD/ENGAGE) against ATT&CK using the pipeline Turtle outputs in tmp.

These are manual verification utilities (not pytest tests) and expect the corresponding tmp/pipeline-stage*.ttl files to exist.

## **Roadmap**

* **Short-term (0-3 months):** Complete CI SHACL gating, add missing per-OWL positive/negative samples, and automate validator runs in `src/core/`.
* **Mid-term (3-9 months):** Expand modular OWL coverage (additional standards), automate ingestion pipelines, add RAG enforcement hooks, and produce more example traversal templates.
* **Long-term (9-18 months):** Build a web UI for traversal visualization, full CI enforcement for OWL/SHACL changes, and integrate explainable LLM-backed query interfaces.

## **Current Status**

* **Core Ontology:** Modular OWL files and core invariants are implemented under `docs/ontology/`.
* **SHACL Validation:** Validation module at `src/core/validation.py` with CLI entry points; machine-readable reports stored in `artifacts/`; CI gating is scaffolded but not fully enforced.
* **Ingestion:** ETL transformers for all 9 standards live in `src/etl/` (e.g., `etl_cve.py`, `etl_cpe.py`); pre-ingest pipeline in `src/ingest/pipeline.py` with validation gates; ready for Neo4j integration.
* **RAG Safety:** Traversal templates and safety rules are documented; runtime enforcement and query-time validation remain to be completed.
* **Integrations & UI:** Neo4j loader and sample data are present; a production UI is planned but not yet implemented.
